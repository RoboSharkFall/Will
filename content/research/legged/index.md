With the development of artificial intelligence and autonomous navigation technology, quadruped robot has been widely used in industry and life. However, the existing quadruped robot also faces the problems of high motor requirements and low energy efficiency. In this reaserch, a quadruped robot leg equipped with parallel elastic actuators is designed to improve the quadruped robot's energy efficiency and movement ability.

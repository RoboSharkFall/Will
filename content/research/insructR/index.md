The ability to provide comprehensive explanations of chosen actions is a hallmark of intelligence. In this work, we try to instruct the robot with some easy order(such as pull, pick) to perform a diverse range of tasks in a large variety of environments in the physical world at the human level.  April tags localization and toward sample-efficient, generalizable, compositional, and incremental robot learning are used in this project.

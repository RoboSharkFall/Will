I am currently enrolled as a Master's student at the National University of Singapore(NUS), pursuing my studies in Mechanical Engineering. My research interests include robotics, control, mechanisms, and machine learning. In 2021, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in mechatronics and automation Engineering from Wuhan University(WHU).
